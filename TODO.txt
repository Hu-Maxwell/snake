snake eating apple code:  (put inside updateSnake) 
// note: these can prolly be turned into one if statement with cleaner code

- IF head == apple 
- IF one in length (head == tail) 
  - newTail = head->position.first
  - newTail = head->position.second

  - move head forward

  - newTail->next = head
  - head->prev = newTail
  - tail = newTail 

- IF more than one in length
  - snake's head should not change, instead add one at the tail
  - copy and allocate space for tail, name it newTail 

  - newTail = tail->position.first
  - newTail = tail->position.second
  - newTail.prev = tail.prev
  - tail->next->prev = newTail

  - move the tail in front of head 

  - head->next = tail
  - tail->prev = head
  - tail->next = nullptr

  - update head and tail
  - head = tail
  - tail = newTail
